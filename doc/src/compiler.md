IDL syntax
==========

A Bond schema definition file can contain the following elements:

- Import statements
- Namespace definition
- Declarations
    - enum
    - forward declaration
    - struct
    - generics
    - struct view
- Custom attributes
- Comments


Import statements
------------------

In order to use types defined in another schema definition file, the other file
needs to be explicitly imported. Schema file can contain zero or more import
statements and they must appear at the top of the file:

    import "file.bond"

The file being imported can be specified using a partial path which is resolved
by Bond compiler relative to the directory containing the schema file being
compiled and any import path(s) specified using the --import-dir option(s) 
passed to gbc.

See examples:

- `examples/cpp/core/import`
- `examples/cs/core/import`

Namespace definition
--------------------

All schema types are always defined within a namespace. Namespace scope starts
with namespace definition statement and ends at the end of the file.

    namespace some.unique.name


Enum definition
---------------

Bond enums are very similar to C++ enums, both in semantics and syntax used to
define them:

    enum Protocols
    {
        TCP,
        UDP = 10
    }

On the wire values of enums types are equivalent to 32-bit signed integers.


Forward declaration
-------------------

In order to define recursive schemas, such as trees, it may be necessary to
declare a struct before it is defined. A forward declaration statement serves
this purpose:

    struct Node;

Forward declared structs can be used in field declarations as the base type for
nullable\<T\> and bonded\<T\> or the element type of a container.

    struct Node;

    struct Node
    {
        0: nullable<Node> left;
        1: nullable<Node> right;
    }


Struct definition
-----------------

Struct definition consists of a struct name, an optional base struct, and zero 
or more fields. 

    struct Example : Base
    {
        0: uint32 fieldName = 10;
    }

Field definition consists of an ordinal, type, name and optional default value.
Field type can be:

- Basic type: `bool`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `int8`, `int16`,
`int32`, `int64`, `float`, `double`, `string`, `wstring`.

- Container: `blob`, `list<T>`, `vector<T>`, `set<T>`, `map<K, T>`,
`nullable<T>`.

- User-defined type: enum, struct or `bonded<T>` where T is a struct.

An optional default value can be specified for fields of basic types. For 
integers the default can be specified as either a decimal number or a 
hexadecimal number prefixed with `0x`. The only explicit default value allowed 
for containers is [`nothing`](#default-value-of-nothing). Enum fields must have 
an explicit default value which must be one of the enum named constants.

Names of structs and enums defined in another namespace must be qualified with 
the namespace name:

    import "bond/core/bond.bond"

    namespace example

    struct Example
    {
        0: bond.GUID id;
        1: bond.BondDataType type = BT_UNAVAILABLE;
    }

Generics
--------

Generic structs are parameterized with one or more type parameters which can be 
used within the struct definition in any place where a concrete type could be 
used (e.g. base struct, field type, container element type, parameter of a 
generic struct).

    struct Example<T1, T2> : T1
    {
        0: T1 field;
        1: list<T2> list;
        2: Generic<T2> generic;
    }

Usage of a type parameter within a generic struct definition may implicitly 
constrain what type(s) can be used to instantiate the generic struct:

    struct Example<T>
    {
        // The default value of 10 implicitly constrains T to numeric types
        0: T x = 10;
    }

Using a type parameter in a [`nullable`](#nullable-types) or as the type of 
a field with default value of [`nothing`](#default-value-of-nothing) constrains 
the type parameter to be non-scalar type. If this is undesired then explicit 
constraint to value type can be specified in the generic schema definition:

    struct Example<T : value>
    {
        0: nullable<T> x;
        1: T y = nothing;
    }

When instantiating a generic struct all type parameters must be concrete types. 
Bond IDL doesn't support the equivalent of C++ template template parameters. 

See examples:

- `examples/cpp/core/generics`
- `examples/cs/core/generics`
- `examples/cpp/core/generic_tree`


Type aliases
------------

The syntax to define type aliases is very similar to C++:

    using time = int64;
    using array<T> = vector<T>;

An alias can be used in any context where the aliased type could be used, 
including a definition of another alias:

    using times = array<time>;

Type aliases can optionally be [mapped to custom types](#custom-type-mappings) 
in the generated code.

See examples:

- `examples/cpp/core/time_alias`
- `examples/cpp/core/multiprecision`
- `examples/cpp/core/string_ref`
- `examples/cpp/core/container_of_pointers`
- `examples/cpp/core/static_array`
- `examples/cs/core/date_time`
- `examples/cs/core/decimal`
- `examples/cs/core/guid`
- `examples/cs/core/container_alias`

Struct views
------------

A view definition is syntactic sugar to define a struct that has a subset of 
the fields of another struct:

    struct Example
    {
        0: int16 x;
        1: string y;
        2: list<bool> z;
    }

    struct View view_of Example
    {
        x,z;
    }

In the above example, the definition of `View` is equivalent to:

    struct View
    {
        0: int16 x;
        2: list<bool> z;
    }

A view of a generic struct is also a generic struct with the same number of 
type parameters.

A view of a sealed struct is always sealed. A view of non-sealed struct can be 
defined to be sealed:

    sealed struct View view_of Example
    {
        x,
        z;
    }

See example: `examples/cpp/core/schema_view`


Custom attributes
-----------------

Struct, enum and field definitions can be annotated with custom attributes 
which are in effect name, string-values pairs:

    [Validate("True")]
    struct Example
    {
        [Max("100")]
        0: uint32 value;
    }

Attributes are available in code generation templates and thus can be used to 
drive custom code generation. They are also available to applications via 
[compile-time](#compile-time-schema) and [runtime](#runtime-schema) schema, and
as `Metadata` argument in [transforms](#transforms) and [protocols](#protocols).

See example: `examples/cpp/core/attributes`


Comments
--------

Bond IDL supports C++ style comments:

    /*
        Multi-line 
        comment
    */
    struct Example
    {
        // One line comment
    }


Schema AST
==========

The compiler exposes a JSON representation of the schema Abstract Syntax Tree. 
The AST is intended for tools that need to access to the schema information 
contained in Bond IDL files with the full fidelity. The compiler can also take 
the JSON representation of the AST as an input, enabling tools which 
programmatically construct/modify Bond schemas.

Example
-------

Given the following schema definition:

    namespace example.some

    struct SomeStruct
    {
        0: int32 someField = 123;
    }

Below is the JSON representation of the schema's Abstract Syntax Tree generated
using `gbc schema example.bond` command:

    {
      "imports": [],
      "namespaces": [
        {
          "name": [
              "example",
              "some"
          ]
        }
      ],
      "declarations": [
        {
          "tag": "Struct",
          "declNamespaces": [
            {
              "name": [
                  "example",
                  "some"
              ]
            }
          ],
          "declAttributes": [],
          "declParams": [],
          "declName": "SomeStruct",
          "structFields": [

              "fieldOrdinal": 0,
              "fieldType": "int32",
              "fieldName": "someField",
              "fieldDefault": {
                "value": 123,
                "type": "integer"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

### Complex types

Complex types are represented by JSON objects with a `type` property indicating 
the complex type. If the `type` property is one of the following: `"vector"`, 
`"list"`, `"set"`, `"nullable"`, `"maybe"`, `"bonded"` then the object has the 
following structure:

    {
      "type": "vector",
      "element": {
      }
    }

where `element` is the [type](#type) of the element (or the nested type).

Other complex types are:

- map

    ```cpp
    {
      "type": "map",
      "key": {
      },
      "element": {
      }
    }
    ```

    - `key` is the [type](#type) of the map key.
    - `element` is the [type](#type) of map value.

- type parameter

      }
    }
    ```

    where `value` is a [type parameter](#type-parameter).

- numeric type argument

    {
      "type": "constant,
      "value": 0
    }
    ```

    where `value` is an integer.

- user defined type

    ```cpp
    {
      "type": "user",
      "declaration": {
      },
      "arguments": [
      ]
    }
    ```

    where:

    - `declaration` is a [declaration](#declaration) of a user defined type.
    - `arguments` is an array of zero or more [types](#type) representing type 
    arguments for a generic user defined type. The property is optional and
    may be omitted for non-generic types.

Runtime Schema
==============

Bond defines `SchemaDef` structure to represent Bond schemas at runtime.
`SchemaDef` is accepted as an argument by various Bond APIs. For example when
transcoding binary payload into a text protocol like JSON, the `SchemaDef` of
the payload is used to provide the necessary meta-data such as names of the
fields.

Usually `SchemaDef` is produced at runtime using Bond APIs. However in some
scenarios it may be desirable to be able to obtain `SchemaDef` object(s)
directly from a schema definition IDL file. The compiler can generate
`SchemaDef` serialized in Simple JSON protocol which can be deserialized using
standard Bond APIs.

Example
-------

Given the following schema definition contained a file `example.bond`:

    namespace example.some

    struct SomeStruct
    {
        0: int32 someField = 123;
    }

The command `gbc schema --runtime-schema example.bond` would produce a file
named `example.SomeStruct.json` with the following content:

    {
      "structs": [
        {
          "metadata": {
            "qualified_name": "example.some.SomeStruct",
            "name": "SomeStruct"
          },
          "fields": [
            {
              "metadata": {
                "default_value": {
                  "int_value": 123
                },
                "name": "someField"
              },
              "id": 0,
              "type": {
                "id": 16
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    
Library
=======

The Bond IDL compiler and codegen functionality is accessible programatically
via the [bond](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bond) Haskell package. The
library can be used to implement custom codegen tools. See examples/codegen in
the repository.
